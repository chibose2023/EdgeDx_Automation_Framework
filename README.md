# EdgeDx_Automation_Framework
Create a backend automation framework in python for a rapidapi endpoint 

This framework was created using Github. Github is very straight forward to use.
1) Create the unit tests locally and test to ensure it passes
2) Create an account on github
3) Create a repository
4) In the repository create a folder for the unit test called 'tests'
5) Within the tests folder add the unit test file
6) Create a .github/workflows/workflows.yml file. This will be the workflow for github actions to run the test
7) Within the workflow file, there should be instructions that will trigger a build upon push commits. Consequently, all subsequent push to main will trigger a build on github actions which will run the unit test
